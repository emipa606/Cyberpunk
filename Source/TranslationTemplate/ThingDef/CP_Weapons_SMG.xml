Firing this weapon is about as close as you can legally come to attempting suicide.... except that even owning this weapon is considered a felony in almost every civilized country in the world.

It is so unreliable, that if fired at full auto the barrels heat up so fast and so hot that they warp each other as they alternate fire, since the barrels are so short they also tend to cook off the ammo in the breach setting off the other rounds as well.
