[h1]Overview[/h1]
The Cyberpunk mod adds elements of the Cyberpunk 2020 RPG game to RimWorld.
It includes the following:

- New guns and melee weapons
- New armors, helmets and apparel added, many with new graphics.
- New cybernetic implants added
- Gun reliability and jamming
- Includes Pardeike's Harmony library

If you like this mod, try the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2846910032]Cyberpunk Factions[/url] expansion.  It adds several corps to the game in addition to the outlanders.
I also suggest using the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=735241897]Mending[/url] Mod, which will allow you to fix and maintain your guns, as well as clean up the gear from your fallen enemies to make them usable again.

[b]There is always the possibility that this mod has bugs. Please report any issues that you might run into[/b]

All current and past versions of this mod can be downloaded from GitHub.
